              We prioritize the privacy and dignity of our users. Cognia utilizes advanced computer vision (pose estimation) to verify physical gestures during exercises.

              <strong>All video processing occurs entirely on your device.</strong>

            <p>
              At no point is live video, recorded video, or photographic imagery transmitted to our servers or any third-party cloud. The application simply converts your movements into anonymous coordinate data (skeletal tracking points) in real-time within your browser, and the visual feed is immediately discarded.

              To provide a dynamic and personalized experience, Cognia collects telemetry data regarding exercise performance (e.g., accuracy, reaction time, consistency).
            </p>
            <p>
              We also allow caregivers to optionally input personal preferences (such as favorite foods, hobbies, and routines). This data is securely stored and utilized by our AI generator to dynamically create personalized cognitive questions tailored specifically to the patient's lived experience.
